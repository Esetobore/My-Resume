## APK
* Android [My Resume.zip](https://github.com/Esetobore/My-Resume/files/9934192/My.Resume.zip)



## Chanllenges
* Automatic Multi Language Support ive run into a series of issues with it and have decided to scrap it for the time being.

## Other Note
* On this app all the data is hard coded in and given more time i would have wanted to allow it to support multiple entries from users who would want to use the app for thier own portfolio and the ability to link all data showed on the app to various refrences that can verify all the infromation entered.
